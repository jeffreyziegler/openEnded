Description: Users can create document similarity measures between a manipulated prompt and participants' open-ended recall of the prompt. Then, users can analyze the overall results by weighting respondents their attention to the prompt. Last, given certain assumptions about the survey design, users can estimate the average treatment effect for those participants that likely received the treatment.
